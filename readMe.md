This is a simple To Do app that I made to try and apply some of the concepts I have learnt.

It has some basic function, like:
- you can add an activity through the text box and it appears on the page (you can click the '+' button or press enter once you have written in the box).
- if the input box is empty, clicking the '+' button or pressing enter will not add anything to the page.
- you can edit activities you have already added on the page as long as it's not ticked.
- you can tick activities you have completed and it will cross out the activity to show that it has been completed. You can't edit it once it's crossed out.
- you can delete activities whenever you wand and it will be removed from the page.
