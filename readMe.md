// Check list for my to do app :)

- need h1 heading, maybe twice normal size, 'To Do'
- need a text bar with a 'go' icon-button (maybe an arrow or smth?)
- on click, the text in the text bar should be transferred into an input-checkbox element inside a div
- if checked, the text should have a line struck through and a delete icon-button next to the text should appear
- if the delete icon-button is clicked, the div element should be deleted
